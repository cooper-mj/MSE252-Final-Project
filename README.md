## Welcome to Group 11's Decision Tool!

This is a guide containing the necessary instructions to setup and run the tool.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.4 or later (can be downloaded [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

## If you're familiar with running Python projects on your machine...
Quick orientation: requirements.txt contains the information that pip3 needs to install the required dependencies. Once you have comfirmed you have both installed, feel free to run the `decision_tool.py` file. 

This should open a new window with the interactive decision tool.

## If you'd like some more detailed setup instructions...
### Installation of NumPy, Matplotlib

Open up Terminal, then navigate into a folder containing the three files in this project. (Since the files are being submitted individually via Canvas, you may need to create such a folder, then add decision_tool.py, requirements.txt, and README.md to that folder).

Once you have navigated into such a folder, run the following command at the prompt:

```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

This should install all the dependencies required to run the project (namely, NumPy and Matplotlib).

### Running the Project
While in the project folder, type the following command at the prompt:
```
$ python3 decision_tool.py
```
This should open a new window with the interactive decision tool.
